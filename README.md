# Overclicked

Overclicked is a web application created by CLIC, used for tracking and managing orders at student-organized events.
It provides simple interfaces for event staff in various roles (at the register, in the preparation area, etc) to monitor incoming orders and update their status in real time.

It was used for the first time at the CLIC silent party, [Subsonic](https://clic.epfl.ch/news/subsonic-f24) in Autumn 2024.
